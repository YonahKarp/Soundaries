Soundaries is an all new location-based ringer manager.

Have you ever been in the office or at school and your phone suddenly goes off playing Justin Beiber's Baby at full volume? Ever missed an important call from your boss because you forgot to turn your phone off vibrate-only? Soundaries is here to end all that.

With Soundaries, you can choose a location and set a ringer volume level. Anytime you enter the area, your phone's ringer will automatically adjust to that level.

Let Soundaries manage your ringer. It can silence your phone for you when you get into work or school and turn back up when you are back at home.
